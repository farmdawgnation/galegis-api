# Contributing Guidelines

There are a few rules of the road for contributing to this project that should be followed.
The list looks something like this:

* **Ticket First** - Before you start working on something, check the active tickets. See
if there isn't someone already working on what you're working on. If not, open a ticket
and get signoff from one of the collaborators on the project.
* **Build your change** - Enough said.
* **Add your name to the contributors file**
* **Follow Code Style** - Generally, our code style consists of indents being two spaces,
names of functions and variables being descriptive (if you push code using the variable
name `i`, I will slap you with a trout), and good code organization being observed.
* **Convert the Issue to a Pull Request** - When you're ready please attach the code you
wrote to the ticket it relates to by converting that ticket to a pull request. This can
be done using [hub](http://hub.github.com/).
* **Participate in Review** - You'll get review from a collaborator. Participate in the
conversation and make updates quickly.

If you generally follow these rules, everyone will be very very happy. I'll update this
as I think of things that may need adding. Cheers!
