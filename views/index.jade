  h1 Georgia Legislative REST API (Alpha)
  p
    | Welcome to the Georgia Legislative REST API (galegis-api, for short). In its current form, galegis-api
    | is in "alpha" state. You should not rely on this service being available at all times or that the
    | information will accurately reflect the information represented on the GGA website at this time. There
    | are probably lots of bugs left to sort out, and if you find any we encourage you to 
    a(href="https://github.com/farmdawgnation/galegis-api/issues", target="_blank") file an issue
    |  in our bug tracker.

  p
    | The purpose of this service is to represent information about the activities of the Georgia General Assembly
    | in a format that's braindead easy to build software against. The current solution offered by the GGA is the use of a
    | WSDL XML-powered service, which is cumbersome to use and doesn't behave exactly like modern software engineers
    | expect remote services to behave. So, we've created an alternative that does.

  p
    | We eventually plan to provide an interface through which humans can easily browse our database, but for now
    | we're optimizing for other programs, since that was the primary intent from the start. All you need to do to
    | get started is to send a request to one of our endpoints.

  h2 Active Endpoints
  
  p The following endpoints currently have data in them. (More to come soon.)
  
  ul
    li
      b
        a(href="/api/v1/sessions") /api/v1/sessions
      |  - All information in our database is somehow associated to the Legislative Sessions of the General Assembly.
      | This API call lists off all the sessions we may have data on. Due to incomplete information from the GGA, we
      | may not have all kinds of data for every session.

    li
      b
        a(href="/api/v1/members") /api/v1/members
      |  - Information on members of the General Assembly can be found here. By default, this API call will list information
      | on members for the most recent legislative session. If you would like information on members from a different session,
      | pass the ID of the session as a query parameter named "sessionId" (so... /api/v1/members?sessionId=....)

    li
      b
        a(href="/api/v1/member/521000b73de13f5bd9be5911") /api/v1/member/:id
      |  - Information on a single member. Replace the ID in the example that we link to for information on a different member.

    li
      b
        a(href="/api/v1/member/521000b73de13f5bd9be5911/votes") /api/v1/member/:id/votes
      |  - IDs of votes the member has participated in, grouped by what their vote was.

    li
      b
        a(href="/api/v1/committees") /api/v1/committees
      |  - List all committees for the currently active session. To retrieve committees for a different
      | session, add a "sessionId" query parameter with the sessionId you'd like to retrieve information
      | on.

    li
      b /api/v1/committee/:id
      |  - List all information on a specific committee.

    li
      b
        a(href="/api/v1/legislation") /api/v1/legislation
      |  - List all legislation for the currently active session. (Or a different one if a "sessionId"
      | query parameter is provided.)

    li
      b /api/v1/legislation/:id
      |  - List all information on a specific piece of legislation.

    li
      b
        a(href="/api/v1/legislation/hr/1") /api/v1/legislation/:type/:number
      |  - Retrieve an item of legislation by its number. So, for H.R. 1 in the current session
      | you'd access /api/v1/legislation/hr/1. To access H.R. 1 from a different session, you'd
      | pass the sessionId as a query parameter. Valid types are: hr, hb, sr, sb.

    li
      b
        a(href="/api/v1/votes") /api/v1/votes
      |  - List all votes for the current session. (Or a different session if a sessionId is
      | provided using a query parameter.)

    li
      b /api/v1/vote/:id
      |  - List all information on a specific vote.
